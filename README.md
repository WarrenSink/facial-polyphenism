# *Reproducible divergences of the facial features of monozygotic twins* #

Files for reproducing data with AWS Rekognition related to a potential polyphenism among monozygotic homo sapiens.

This repo serves as a storage of the scripts in R and python and the csv's needed to reproduce the data; plus the data.

Hopefully, the gathering of this info will lead to other browser-friendly media for visualizing the project and pipeline.
